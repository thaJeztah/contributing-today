## Go at Docker and the Moby project

## About me

- PHP developer in a former life üë¥üèª
- Contributor to Docker since 2013 (version 0.5)
- Moby and Docker open source maintainer üê≥
- Reviewer for the containerd projects
- .. and any other repository I get my hands on üòÖ
- Senior Software Engineer at Docker (since 2015)


## What is the Moby project?

- Upstream open source projects for Docker
- The "docker engine" [github.com/moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby)
- BuildKit (also used to drive `docker build`) [github.com/moby/buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
- Various other libraries and projects


## A history of Go in Moby and Docker

- Originally written in Python
- Early adopter, means "rough edges"
- Building Go from source
- Stability not a guarantee yet, and due to our use, we usually found
  "interesting" corner cases with each release.
- No dependency management or vendoring (DYI)


## Why Go?

- Static binaries meant we could ship fast and often (less important now)
- Extensive set of tools out of the box (test framework, `go fmt`, dependency management)
- Basics are easy to learn, making it easy to contribute
- Opinionated (`go fmt`) helps for a consistent codebase with many contributors
- Huge time-saver when dealing with many contributors
- Cross platform (because Docker would likely never run on Windows üòÖ)


## Dependency management

(in a fast-moving landscape)<br /><br />

- Dependency management can be hard. Go modules _can_ make life easier, but there are pitfalls
- A single line of code can cause [a ripple effect on your dependency tree](https://github.com/microsoft/hcsshim/pull/984)
- If `go mod why` doesn't help, `go mod graph` can come to the rescue
  
  For a quick search who's "asking" for a dependency:<br />
  ```
  go mod graph | grep ' k8s.io/kubernetes'
  # github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim@v0.8.7 k8s.io/kubernetes@v1.13.0
  ```
  <br />(note the space before the dependency)<br /><br />


## Review your dependencies

- Dependencies are "your code" as well; don't be tricked by go modules "hiding them" for you: review changes in your dependencies, and
- ["tagged"](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/thaJeztah/mod@v0.2.0) isn't [always "tagged"](https://github.com/thaJeztah/mod/tags)
- Beware of [**replace** rules](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.5.0-beta.4/go.mod#L68-L75); they are non-transitional!
- SemVer is really _hard_: a projects "minor" change may be a breaking change for you (_hopefully_ apparent immediately)


## Maintain a project?

- Set expectations right; describe things such as:
    - Scope of your project
    - Stability
    - What parts are intended for "external consumption"?
- Go makes it easy to use someone else's (your) code
- Maintaining a library? Use Aliases and `//Deprecated` comments if needed (but strictly, deprecations require a Major release)


## Don't forget the legal stuff

- Pick the right license and [apply it the correct way](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/d30db1f9a915aa95402e1190461469a1889d92be)
- Accepting contributions? [Who owns the copyright?](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/9b8247e5ddb15f3fb9ffe59871172d9a3268af55/cmd/clicheck/check_cli_conventions.go#L2)
- Perhaps you need a CLA, or [require a DCO](https://developercertificate.org) (and a [DCO check](https://github.com/apps/dco))
